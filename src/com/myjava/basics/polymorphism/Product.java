Problem: Create a Product class with a private price field and an applyDiscount method. Create Electronics and Clothing
classes that inherit from Product and override applyDiscount. Use polymorphism in main.*/

/*
Explanation: Combines encapsulation (private price with getters/setters) and polymorphism by
calling overridden applyDiscount methods via Product references.

Practice Tip: Add a Furniture class with a 15% discount.*/
