Problem: Create a Student class with fields for name and age. Add a constructor and a method to display
the details. Create an object in main and call the method.*/

public class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    //Constructor
    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    // Method to display details
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Student name is " + name + " and age is " + age);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
